    The process developed throughout this work can be summarized in four main steps:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Manual imagery acquisition and initial classification
        \item Image pre-processing and segmentation
        \item Image representation and feature extraction 
        \item Fruit classification
    \end{itemize}
    It can be better visualized in Figure \ref{fig:flowchart}.
