The process developed throughout this work can be summarized in four main steps:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manual imagery acquisition and initial classification
    \item Image pre-processing and segmentation
    \item Image representation and feature extraction
    \item Fruit classification
\end{itemize}
It can be better visualized in Figure \ref{fig:flowchart}.
