We photographed all the fruits using the same camera, and then a group of twenty divided them into three classes (A, B, and C) accordingly to their quality. Class A represents the best fruits, almost stainless with minor defects. Class B represents mid-term fruits with a few significant defects limited only to the fruit peel, so the fruits remain edible and practically fresh inside. And Class C represents the ones with severe defects and are considered to be rotten. An example of each class for all the fruits can be seen in \Cref{fig:abiu-classes,fig:caju-amarelo-classes,fig:caju-vermelho-classes,fig:gabiroba-classes,fig:pequi-classes,fig:siriguela-classes}.
