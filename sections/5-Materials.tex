\subsection{Hardware} \label{subsec:hardware}
This work was made by using the Google Colab environment. Google Colab is a free cloud storage service in which it is possible to write and run Jupyter notebooks with support to GPU and TPU.

\subsection{Software} \label{subsec:software}
As Google Colab uses Jupyter notebooks, the scripts were written in Python. As for the libraries, we used scikit-image that provides tools to perform image pre-processing like background segmentation and Tensorflow to build the neural networks.
