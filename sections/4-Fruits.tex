\section{Fruits} \label{sec:fruits}
    We chose the following fruits for this paper: abiu (\textit{pouteria caimito}); two variations of caju (\textit{anacardium occidentale}): yellow-skinned and red-skinned; gabiroba (\textit{campomanesia xanthocarpa}); pequi (\textit{caryocar brasiliense}); and siriguela (\textit{spondias purpurea}). All of them are tropical fruits usually found in Latin America. Some characteristics were taken into account, such as availability, size, shape, and colors.
