\section{Conclusions \& Future Scope} \label{sec:conclusions-&-future-scope}
    
    In this work, we presented some solutions related to the problem of classifying fruit according to their quality. The solutions presented were: a CNN with an RGB or grayscale image; and a DNN with GLCM textural properties. In all of them, a Gabor filter was applied.
    
    The DNN with GLCM textural properties outperformed the other solutions for all of the six fruits with significantly better results in most cases. This means that texture is a key factor when analyzing fruits based on their appearance.
    
    This solution was proved effective since even with a relatively small dataset, i.e. 120 samples, it still managed to achieve great accuracies as stated in the previous section. Further experimentations can be done by using larger datasets and testing even more possible solutions.
